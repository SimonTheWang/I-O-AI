## About
Instead of a mouse, Tony Stark Simulator, or TSS, uses a user's webcam to move their cursor to where their face is pointing towards. Additionally, TSS allows users to map their preferred hand movements for commands such as "click", "minimize", "disable TSS face recognition", and more!
TSS also allows users to input data using their voice, so they don't need to use a keyboard.
